## What is a Stack

To implement a stack we need a top pointer.<br>
The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.

## Types of Stacks

1. **Fixed Size Stack**
- cannot grow or shrink dynamically.
- if you add more elements than its size, then it will produce a stack overflow error.
- if the stack is empty and you remove an element, then you will get an underflow error.

2. **Dynamic size**
- when the stack is full, it automatically increases its size to accommodate the new element.
- this type of stack is implemented with a `LinkedList`.

## Stack applications

1. Infix to Postfix/Prefix conversion.
2. Expression Evaluation.
3. Recursion Stack.
4. Memory Management.
5. Balanced Parenthesis.
6. Undo-Redo.

### Other applications

- Tower of Hanoi.
- Stock span problems.
- Histogram problems.
- etc.

## Implementation

### Using LinkedList

In a linked list-based implementation, the push operation is implemented by creating a new node with the new element and setting the next pointer of the current top node to the new node.

The pop operation is implemented by setting the next pointer of the current top node to the next node and returning the value of the current top node.

_Source [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-stack-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/)._

```swift
final class StackList<T> {
    var top: Node?

    init(top: Node? = nil) {
        self.top = top
    }
}

extension StackList {
    final class Node {
        let data: T
        var link: Node?

        init(_ data: T, next: Node? = nil) {
            self.data = data
            self.link = next
        }
    }
}
```

#### Push and Pop

<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220714004311/Stack-660x566.png" />

#### Push implementation

```swift
func push(_ data: T) {
    let newNode = Node(data)
    guard top != nil else {
        top = newNode
        return
    }

    newNode.link = top
    top = newNode
}
```

#### Pop implementation

```swift
@discardableResult
func pop() -> Node? {
    guard top != nil else {
        return nil
    }

    let nodeToPop = top
    top = nodeToPop?.link
    return nodeToPop
}
```

#### Complexity

| Operations | Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| push | O(1) |
| pop | O(1) |
| isEmpty | O(1) |
| peek | O(1) |

### Using arrays

In an array-based implementation, the push operation is implemented by incrementing the index of the top element and storing the new element at that index.

The pop operation is implemented by decrementing the index of the top element and returning the value stored at that index.

### Pros and Cons

**üòÄ LinkedList**
- Linked list implementation of stack can grow and shrink according to the needs at runtime.

**üòÄ Arrays**
- Easy to implement.
- Memory is saved as pointers are not involved.

**ü•≤ LinkedList**
- Requires extra memory due to the involvement of pointers.
- Random accessing of an element is not possible.

**ü•≤ Arrays**
- In some implementations depending of the programming language, dynamic size is not possible.
- The total size of the stack must be defined beforehand.

## Infix/Postfix/Prefix

**Infix expression**: The expression of the form ‚Äúa operator b‚Äù (a + b) i.e., when an operator is in-between every pair of operands.

**Postfix expression**: The expression of the form ‚Äúa b operator‚Äù (ab+) i.e., When every pair of operands is followed by an operator.

**Prefix expression**: An expression is called the prefix expression if the operator appears in the expression before the operands. Simply of the form (operator operand1 operand2).

**Why?**

The repeated scanning makes it very inefficient. Infix expressions are easily readable and solvable by humans whereas the computer cannot differentiate the operators and parenthesis easily so, it is better to convert the expression to postfix(or prefix) form before evaluation.

Whenever we get an operand, add it to the postfix expression and if we get an operator or parenthesis add it to the stack by maintaining their precedence.

#### Algorithm

1. Scan input string from left to right character by character.
2. If the character is an operand, put it into output stack.
3. If the character is an operator and operator's stack is empty, push operator into operators' stack.
4. If the operator's stack is not empty, there may be following possibilites.
    1. If the precedence of scanned operator is greater than the top most operator of operator's stack, push this operator into operand's stack.
    2. If the precedence of scanned operator is less than or equal to the top most operator of operator's stack, pop the operators from operand's stack until we find a low precedence operator than the scanned character. Never pop out ( '(' ) or ( ')' ) whatever may be the precedence level of scanned character.
    3. If the character is opening round bracket ( '(' ), push it into operator's stack.
    4. If the character is closing round bracket ( ')' ), pop out operators from operator's stack untill we find an opening bracket ('(' ).
    5. Now pop out all the remaining operators from the operator's stack and push into output stack.

    } else if char == ")" {
        while let current = operatorStack.pop(), current != "(" {
            outputStack.push(current)
        }
    } else if let currentOperator = Operator(char) {
        while let topOperator = Operator(operatorStack.peek),
              currentOperator.precedencePriority <= topOperator.precedencePriority,
              !operatorStack.isEmpty,
              operatorStack.peek != "(" {
            outputStack.push(Character(topOperator.rawValue))
            operatorStack.pop()
        }
        operatorStack.push(Character(currentOperator.rawValue))
    }
}
```

</details>

#### Algorithm

- Read the Prefix expression in reverse order (from right to left).
- If the symbol is an operand, then push it onto the Stack.
- If the symbol is an operator, then pop two operands from the Stack:
    - Create a string by concatenating the two operands and the operator between them.
    - `string = (operand1 + operator + operand2)`
    - And push the resultant string back to Stack
- Repeat the above steps until the end of Prefix expression.
- At the end stack will have only 1 string i.e. resultant string.

        let operand1 = stack.pop() ?? ""
        let operand2 = stack.pop() ?? ""
        let result = "(\(operand1)\(char)\(operand2))"

// Prints ((A-(B/C))*(((A/K)-L)*(M+N)))
print(stack.pop() ?? "")
